The Services may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, local shared objects, hardware-based device identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, clear GIFs and web beacons. Apps For Hue treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data. <br/>
Cookies: A “cookie” is a small file stored by your browser when told to do so by a website. Typically websites place a number of different cookies on an end-user’s machine. Some of the cookies are “1st Party,” from the website itself, and others are “3rd party,” belonging to advertising and analytics entities or social networks. Apps For Hue’s cookies do not include personal data and are typically used to quickly identify your device and to “remember” your browser during subsequent visits for purposes of functionality, preferences, and website performance. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Services.<br/>
Flash cookies & HTML5: Apps For Hue may also use Flash cookies (local shared objects) and HTML5 local storage. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies, but which are not stored in the browser and can also be used to remember your settings, to personalize the look and feel of the Services, or for advertising and analytics. You may prevent Flash cookies from being stored by following the instructions provided by Adobe at http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html. <br/>
Web Beacons and pixel tags: A “web beacon” or a “pixel tag” is an electronic image (often not visible to the end-user) that allows Apps For Hue to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. Additionally, e-mails and other electronic communications Apps For Hue sends to you may contain pixel tags that enable Apps For Hue to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed, if any.</p><br/>
<p>9. Third Party Terms and Conditions<br/>
<br/>
Please note that your access to and use of the Services may be subject to certain third party terms and conditions and Apps For Hue is not liable for any such third parties’ use of your personal data.
Certain Services that Apps For Hue may offer, such as multiplayer gaming, social networking and gaming console services, may use third party services to provide authentication for the Services with a gaming console ID, social networking ID, or gaming network account. In connection with such use, certain personally identifiable user and/or membership data may be transferred automatically to and from Apps For Hue.<br/>
Apps For Hue may disclose your personal data to third parties in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of Apps For Hue’s stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern such personal data.</p><br/>
<p>10. Safeguards<br/>
<br/>
Apps For Hue follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information in Apps For Hue’s possession.</p><br/>
<p>11. Other<br/>
<br/>
You may choose to disclose data about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to the Services.<br/>
Any data that you disclose in any of these forums, blogs, chats or the like will become public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality with respect to that data. 
Apps For Hue may store and/or transfer your personal data to its affiliates and partners in and outside of EU/EEA member states and the United States in accordance with mandatory legislation and this Privacy Policy.</p><br/>
<p>12. Special Note about Children’s Privacy<br/>
<br/>
Apps For Hue does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If Apps For Hue learns that Apps For Hue has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under 13 years of age, Apps For Hue will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such personal data from Apps For Hue’s records. 
Apps For Hue understands the need to provide extra privacy protections to users who are children. To that end, features and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviorally targeted advertising, and collection of data for the purpose of building user profiles are not available to users under 13. Apps For Hue also does not allow our third party partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13.<br/>
Apps For Hue and its partners do collect non-personally identifiable data from children. This includes, for example, collection of IP-based geolocation data to ensure that the product, service or features served comply with applicable laws of that nation.<br/>
Apps For Hue and its partners also collect data to assess general information about the use of products, such as the number of visitors to our sites and services and which sections of a site or service are popular. Apps For Hue also uses this data to provide contextually-relevant advertising to users, to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to allow users to personalize their experience on the site or service (for example, to save a high score in a game). Apps For Hue and its partners may also use cookies, pixels, hardware-based identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, and software-set identifiers, to manage and measure the performance of advertising.<br/>
Please note that Apps For Hue’s partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and ad-serving purposes. While Apps For Hue requires that companies comply with Apps For Hue’s privacy policy before Apps For Hue allows those companies to access our sites and services, Apps For Hue does not actually control third-party data collection and use. Apps For Hue encourages parents to review the list of operators below and to become familiar with those parties policies and practices.<br/>
If you have additional questions about Apps For Hue’s Privacy Practices related to children under the age of 13, please contact us at contact@appsforhue.com, or alternatively at Apps For Hue Ltd., Legal Department, 440 Tan Son Nhi Street, Tan Quy Ward, Tan Phu District, Ho Chi Minh city, Viet Nam.</p><br/>
